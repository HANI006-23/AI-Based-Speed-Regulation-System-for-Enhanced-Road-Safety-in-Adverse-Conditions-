# AI-Based-Speed-Regulation-System-for-Enhanced-Road-Safety-in-Adverse-Conditions-
A context-aware braking prototype using Python and OpenCV that adjusts vehicle speed in real-time based on webcam input. Designed for improved road safety in low-visibility conditions like fog and rain, it autonomously detects obstacles and regulates speed for smarter, safer, and energy-efficient driving.
